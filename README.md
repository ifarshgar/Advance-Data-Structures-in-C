# Advanced Data Structures in C programming language. 

## Generic Queue
 With **```void*```** various data types can be handled in C language. 
 This generic queue implementation comes with mulltiple options as for the queue data type 
 that can be used upon creating and manipulating the queue. 
 Furtheremore, the queue is built with LinkedList data structure. 
 Also it is worth mentioning that operations like **push()** and **pop()** has been implemented to have the **time complexity of ```O(1)```**. 

 ```C
 struct Queue {
    void *data;
    struct Queue* next;
 };
 ```
